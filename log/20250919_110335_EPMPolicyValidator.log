Despite assigning the default policies to the user, the user has reported that elevation does not work after restarting the machine, so he needs to connect VPN after each restart. Therefore, created a new policy at the moment since the user works with different vendors' applications and sometimes is offsite.   was found

2025-09-19 13:21:04 [INFO ] Policy 'RUN_APP_ERMS_AlwaysElevate_C' - Ticket number to be confirmed (already created).
This Policy has been created as a matter of workaround for some users where the program E-RMS is requiring admin elevation. This program normally DOESN'T REQUIRE admin elevation for most of computers but for some reason it is asking for it on:

CATLS40100
CATLS40113
CATLN10131
CATLN10111
CATLN10137

*Program is been gotten from the same source.

We believe this is an issue at the OS/Software level and not directly to CyberArk EPM, nevertheless, due the urgency this permission represents for this team I'm making this possible.
